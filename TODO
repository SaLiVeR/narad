Today:

Chat view with support for new chat and continuing old chats.
Current idea:
Have to "To: " bar on top to hold the user avatar. When in editing mode (ie users being added/removed) 
  this looks like the Messages app view. When not in editing mode, the avatars show up.

Creating a conversation is special case (start off with users being added.)


CURRENT:
 Add auto complete in "New messages view." Make it  work like iphone mail app.
